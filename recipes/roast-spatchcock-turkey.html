<p>This spatchcock turkey recipe results in the juiciest, crispiest turkey cooked in a fraction of the time it usually takes to roast a whole turkey.<br>
If you've never tried it, spatchcocking is easier than you might think!<br>
By removing the backbone and flattening out the bird, you'll reduce cooking time and make carving a whole lot easier, too! Once you try it, you might never go back.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon crushed black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a roasting rack on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Place turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Using a pair of sharp heavy-duty kitchen shears, cut along one side of the backbone. <br>Repeat on the other side of the backbone. Remove backbone and reserve for making turkey stock for gravy.</li>
    <li>Press firmly down onto both sides of turkey to flatten. Flip turkey breast-side up and put on the roasting rack. Tuck wing tips under turkey (behind breast). <br>Pat skin dry and rub olive oil over entire turkey. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet every 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to roast until skin is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes more. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover loosely with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
</ol>
